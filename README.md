# LINQ_toXML_training
In this repository, I have gathered material that I used to prepare for the C# programming exam on LINQ to XML. It contains several projects and .cs and .xml files. The task descriptions for these assignments can be found in the README file in each project folder. I wish you successful and productive learning of LINQ to XML. P.S. I scored 49 out of 50 on the exam.
